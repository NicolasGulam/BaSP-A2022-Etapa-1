## Project status
### Week 01
In the first week I was in a team and we had to do all the UI of the Landing page. We worked for a full week using 
Figma, a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool, primarily web-based.
### Week 02
In the second week, The principal objetive was to learn HTML, GIT and Github. The first thing i started doing was to 
program the structure of the landing page utilizing HTML, meanwhile I had to create the local repository using git in 
order to create versions of all the progress and then upload it to a remote repository that in this case was github. 
Also, i had to do a read me where i can explain all the information of Trackgenix project.
### Week 03
In this third week, we had to do the landing page in a pixel perfect way with CSS and continue using Git and Github for 
pushing every version of the progress we do. For this week we had the challenge of not using anything related to 
flexbox or grid making the landing more difficult to order.
### Week 04
In the fourth week, we replicated the landing page of the screenflow of week 01 that works in mobile, tablet and 
desktop.
The objective was to use Flexbox as the main tool for the creation of the Responsive Design following the concept of 
Mobile First.
### Week 05
In the week number 5:
On the one hand, we had some practical exercises of Javascript applying the concepts learned.
On the other hand, we had to modify and correct the files of week 4 that was about the responsive design of the landing 
page.
Try them out here: https://nicolasgulam.github.io/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1/Semana-05/index.html
### Week 06
In the sixth week, we had to make the html, css and javascript files of the Log in and Sign Up sections for the 
Employee, adding all the necessary validations in the inputs. Then, in the case of finishing it, we had to 
perform the validations in the contact section of the landing.
